# Getting to know your data 1

## Any data analysis should start with basic quality control

1. Assess data relevance&lt;br&gt;
  (Can the data answer your question in principle?)

--

2. Assess data providence&lt;br&gt;
  (Where does the data come from? Is it reliable?)

--

3. Clean data if required&lt;br&gt;
  (In practice, this is 70-80% of data analysis work)
  
--

4. Perform descriptive analysis and sanity checks&lt;br&gt;
  (Inspect summary statistics, distributions, scatter plots, etc.)

## Accuracy means low bias, precision means low noise

## Usability requires a data dictionary

**Data Dictionary**&lt;br&gt;
A "centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary))

&lt;br&gt;
Example: [Palmer penguins reference page](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html)

What's the difference between `RaceMom` and `MomRace`?

---

## Detailed quality checks: Look at all column names

From the data dictionary:

- `RaceMom`&lt;br&gt;Mother's race: `1`=white, `2`=black, `3`=American Indian, `4`=Chinese,
`5`=Japanese, `6`=Hawaiian, `7`=Filipino, or `8`=Other Asian or Pacific Islander

- `MomRace`&lt;br&gt;Mother's race: `black`, `hispanic`, `other`, or `white`

--

These are similar but not the same. Important not to confuse them!

## In some cases, nonsensical values indicate missingness

We need to make sure to catch those cases:

  na = c("", "NA", "#N/A")
) %&gt;% replace_with_na_at("Weeks", ~.x &lt; 0) # only change column "Weeks" to be safe
```

Before recoding -999 to `NA`:
.xtiny-font[

## Recode multiple categories with `case_when()`

The mother's race is encoded as integers from 1 through 8:

.small-font[

```r
NCbirths %&gt;%
  pull(RaceMom) %&gt;%
  unique() # list all the unique values (ordered by first occurrence)
```

```
[1] 1 5 2 3 4 7 8
```
]

## Recode multiple categories with `case_when()`



We use `case_when()` to recode multiple values all at once:

.xtiny-font.pull-left[

```r
NCbirths %&gt;%
  mutate(
    RaceMom = case_when(
      RaceMom == 1 ~ "white",
      RaceMom == 2 ~ "black",
      RaceMom == 3 ~ "American Indian",
      RaceMom == 4 ~ "Chinese",
      RaceMom == 5 ~ "Japanese",
      RaceMom == 6 ~ "Hawaiian",
      RaceMom == 7 ~ "Filipino",
      RaceMom == 8 ~ 
        "Other Asian or Pacific Islander",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_ # should never reach
    )
  )
