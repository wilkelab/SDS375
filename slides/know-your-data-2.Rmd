**Details and Source**<br>
This dataset contains data on a sample of 1450 birth records from 2001 that statistician John Holcomb at Cleveland State University selected from the North Carolina State Center for Health and Environmental Statistics.

## Some real-world examples

Let's review three datasets on Kaggle:

- [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

- [Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)

- [Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)

## Working with missing values in R

---

## R propagates missingness

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4)

sum(x)
```

--

```{r}
mean(x)
```

--

```{r}
x == 2
```


---

## Many functions allow explicit exclusion of `NA` values

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4)

sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

```{r}
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

But is this the right thing to do?

---

## There is no general right or wrong approach

```{r}
x <- c(2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, NA, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

```{r}
x <- c(NA, NA, NA, 2, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, NA)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

R's default is conservative: If there's at least one `NA`, the result is `NA`

---

## We need to use `is.na()` to check for missing values

.small-font[
```{r}
c(1, 2, NA, 4) == NA   # does not work
is.na(c(1, 2, NA, 4))  # works
```
]

---

## There are several missing values of different types

- `NA`: logical constant indicating missing value

- `NA_integer_`: missing integer

- `NA_real_`: missing real

- `NA_complex_`: missing complex value

- `NA_character_`: missing string


---

## Sometimes the type matters

```{r}
c(1, 2, NA)
c(1, 2, NA_real_)
c(1, 2, NA_character_)
```

---

## Sometimes the type matters

.small-font[
This does not work, type mismatch:
```{r}
#if_else(TRUE, "result if true", NA)
```

This works:
```{r}
if_else(TRUE, "result if true", NA_character_)
```
]

--

.small-font[
Similarly:
```{r}
#if_else(TRUE, 1234, NA)      # does not work
if_else(TRUE, 1234, NA_real_) # works
```
]

---

## Replacing `NA` values

Remember from class on data wrangling:

.small-font[
```{r, message = FALSE}
band_data <- full_join(band_members, band_instruments)
band_data
```
]

---

## Replacing `NA` values

Replace `NA`s with empty strings in `plays` column:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(plays = replace_na(plays, ""))
```
]


---

## Replacing `NA` values

Replace `NA`s with empty strings in all columns:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(.x, "")))
```
]

---

## Replacing `NA` values

Replace empty strings with `NA` in `plays` column (requires **naniar** package):

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(.x, ""))) %>%
  replace_with_na_at("plays", ~.x == "")
```
]

---

## Replacing `NA` values

Replace empty strings with `NA` in all columns (requires **naniar** package):

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(.x, ""))) %>%
  replace_with_na_all(~.x == "")
```
]

---

## Removing rows with `NA` values

Remove all rows with any `NA`s with `na.omit()`:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  na.omit()
```
]

---

## Removing rows with `NA` values

Remove all rows where specific columns contain `NA`s:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(plays))
```
]

---

## Removing rows with `NA` values

Conversely:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  filter(is.na(plays))
```
]

---

## Visualizing `NA`s

.small-font.pull-left.width-40[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(NCbirths) +
  aes(Weeks, Gained) +
  geom_point()
```

By default, missing points are not shown
]

.pull-right.xtiny-font.width-55[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing-out, ref.label = "NCbirths-plot-missing", echo = FALSE, fig.width = (.618*6/.75), fig.height = 0.618*6, dev = "svg"}
```
]


---

## Visualizing `NA`s

.small-font.pull-left.width-40[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing2, eval = FALSE}
library(naniar)

ggplot(NCbirths) +
  aes(Weeks, Gained) +
  geom_miss_point()
```

Can show them with the **naniar** package
]

.pull-right.xtiny-font.width-55[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing2-out, ref.label = "NCbirths-plot-missing2", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 0.618*6, dev = "svg"}
```
]
