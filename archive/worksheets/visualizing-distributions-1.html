<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this worksheet, we will discuss how to display distributions of data values using histograms and density plots.</p>
<p>We will be using the R package <strong>tidyverse</strong>, which includes <code>ggplot()</code> and related functions.</p>

<p>If you don’t specify how many bins you want or how wide you want them to be, <code>geom_histogram()</code> will make an automatic choice, but it will also give you a warning that the automatic choice is probably not good. Make a better choice by setting the <code>binwidth</code> and <code>center</code> parameters. Try the values 5 and 2.5, respectively.</p>

<h2>Density plots</h2>
<p>Density plots are a good alternative to histograms. We can create them with <code>geom_density()</code>. Try this out by drawing a density plot of the passenger ages (column <code>age</code> in the dataset <code>titanic</code>). Also, by default <code>geom_density()</code> does not draw a filled area under the density line. We can change this by setting an explicit fill color, e.g. “cornsilk”.</p>

<p>Just like for histograms, there are options to modify how much detail a density plot shows. A small binwidth in a histogram corresponds to a low bandwidth (<code>bw</code>) in a density plot and similarly a large binwidth corresponds to a high bandwidth. In addition, you can change the kernel, e.g. <code>kernel = "rectangular"</code> or <code>kernel = "triangular"</code>. Try this out by using a bandwidth of 1 and a triangular kernel.</p>

<div id="section-small-multiples-facets" class="section level2">
<h2>Small multiples (facets)</h2>
<p>We can also draw separate histograms for passengers meeting different criteria, for example for passengers traveling in the different classes. Whenever we draw multiple plot panels containing the same type of plot but for different subsets of the data, we speak of “small multiples”. In ggplot, we generate small multiples with the function <code>facet_wrap()</code>. The function <code>facet_wrap()</code> takes as its argument a list of data columns to subdivide the data by. This list is provided via the <code>vars()</code> function. For example, <code>vars(class)</code> means draw a separate panel for each class, <code>vars(survived)</code> means draw a separate panel for each survival status, and <code>vars(class, survived)</code> means draw a separate panel for each combination of class and survival status.</p>
<p>As an example, the following code generates small multiple histograms by class:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(titanic, aes(age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(class))</code></pre>
<p><img src="visualizing-distributions-1_files/figure-html/titanic-hist-class-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Now use the same principle to draw small multiple histograms by survival status.</p>

<p>Notice the difference between this plot and the corresponding histogram plot. Histograms show absolute counts whereas the density plots are normalized so that the area under the curve is 1. As a consequence, the density plot does not provide an accurate representation of the number of passengers in each grouping. This can be changed. See next section.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-manipulating-stats" class="section level2">
<h2>Manipulating stats</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that neither <code>geom_histogram()</code> nor <code>geom_density()</code> require you to define an aesthetic mapping for the <code>y</code> variable. This is because under the hood, a statistical transformation (called a “stat”) calculates the histogram or density from the raw data and then sets the appropriate y mapping.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be useful to access or modify this mapping directly. We tell ggplot that we want to map a value calculated by a stat, rather than one that is in the original data, by writing <code>after_stat(...)</code> inside the <code>aes()</code> function. So, for example, the default y mapping for <code>geom_density()</code> is <code>y = after_stat(density)</code>. An alternative mapping, <code>y = after_stat(count)</code> scales densities by the number of points in each grouping, thus producing something more similar to a histogram. You can see the difference between these two choices in the following two examples:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># use the default y mapping
ggplot(titanic, aes(age, y = after_stat(density))) + 
  geom_density(fill = &quot;cornsilk&quot;, bw = 2) +
  facet_wrap(vars(survived, class))</code></pre>
<p><img src="visualizing-distributions-1_files/figure-html/titanic-dens-after-stat-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code># use a modified y mapping
ggplot(titanic, aes(age, y = after_stat(count))) + 
  geom_density(fill = &quot;cornsilk&quot;, bw = 2) +
  facet_wrap(vars(survived, class))</code></pre>
<p><img src="visualizing-distributions-1_files/figure-html/titanic-dens-after-stat-2.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The same options of <code>after_stat(count)</code> and <code>after_stat(density)</code> exist for <code>geom_histogram()</code> as well. Try this by making histograms that use the calculated density for the y value.</p>
