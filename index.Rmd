## Computing requirements

For students enrolled in this course, you only need a working web browser to access the edupod server, located at: https://edupod.cns.utexas.edu/

**If you are using the edupod server, stop reading here. Everything is pre-installed and no further action is needed.**

To run any of the materials locally on your own machine, you will need the following:

- A recent version of R, [download from here.](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
- A recent version of RStudio, [download from here.](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- The following R packages:    
  cluster, colorspace, cowplot, distill, gapminder, GGally, gganimate, ggiraph, ggdendro, ggdist, ggforce, ggplot2movies, ggrepel, ggridges, ggthemes, gifski, knitr, learnr, naniar, margins, MASS, Matrix, nycflights13, palmerpenguins, patchwork, rmarkdown, rnaturalearth, rnaturalearthhires, sf, shinyjs, tidyverse, transformr, umap, xaringan

You can install all required R packages at once by running the following code in the R command line:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# first run this command:
install.packages(
  c(
    "cluster", "colorspace", "cowplot", "distill", "gapminder", 
    "GGally", "gganimate", "ggiraph", "ggdendro", "ggdist", "ggforce",
    "ggplot2movies", "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "gifski",
    "knitr", "learnr", "naniar", "margins", "MASS", "Matrix",
    "nycflights13", "palmerpenguins", "patchwork", "rmarkdown",
    "rnaturalearth", "sf", "shinyjs", "tidyverse", "transformr", "umap",
    "xaringan"
  )
)

# then run this command:
install.packages(
  "rnaturalearthhires", repos = "https://packages.ropensci.org", type = "source"
